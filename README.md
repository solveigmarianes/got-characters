# Game of Thrones Character Library

## What is it
A simple web-app that lists characters from the HBO TV series "Game of Thrones", sourced from the [Game of Thrones Character API](https://thronesapi.com/)

## Possible future improvements
- Performance: 
  - Caching API response (using service worker?)
- Usability: 
  - Sorting data
  - More and better filters
- User experience:
  - Add animated layout transitions 
- Code: 
  - Use React.Context to wrap data source(s)
  - Write tests
  - Generify components and stylesheets
- Content:
  - Expand and improve content by writing own API (the source data has errors)
    - More characters
    - More metadata on each character, perhaps a short bio, some quotes?
    - Cross-referencing related characters
    - Add houses data with sigil, words, region, allegiance, religion etc.
    - Add places (cities, landmarks, castles) data with founder/builder, region, ownership etc.
